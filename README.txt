Description
===================
NETwork Attacks (NETA) is a framework devised to simulate attacks in 
heterogeneous networks using OMNeT++. NETA is aimed to be an useful 
tool in the network security field. This tool could make easy to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of defense security techniques or 
solutions against network attacks as well as for comparing the 
capabilities of different defense techniques. NETA is a 
INET 2.1.0 based framework. INET provides realistic implementations 
of structures and protocols on each protocol layers, especially 
in the higher ones: network, transport and application layers. For example, 
INET develops Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) routing protocols as AODV, 
DSR, OLSR, etc., and several TCP implementations as well as several 
applications. Thanks to the versatile and extensible schema of NETA, 
a huge amount attacks could be implemented in each protocol layer.
 
Additionally,  NETA is intended to be a reference base tool for 
the network attacks simulation and implementation with research 
purposes.
